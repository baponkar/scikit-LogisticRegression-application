A simple and detail applicational analysis of sci kit learn LogisticRegression model .
* Description : In this program uses 'titanic.csv'download link
              (https://sololearn.com/uploads/files/titanic.csv)
              as data source which has
              [Survived,Pclass,Sex,Age,Siblings/Spouces,Parents/Children
              Fare] columns.Survived has two data 1[True] and 0[False].
              It has total 887 row and 7 columns features.
              In this program I am using logisticRegression model
              to train and predict the data.Logisticregression model
              doesnot return just a prediction ,but it returns a probability
              level from 0 to 1.It has following parameters
              [penalty,dual,tol,C,fit_intercept,intercept_scalling,
              class_weight,random_state,solver,max_iter,multi_class,verbose,
              warm-start,n_jobs,l1_ratio].
              My python version is python-3.6.9 and
              Sci-kit learning version-0.20.2
